To start a journey we need a plan for our course of action. 

## Journey So Far

I have been in Machine Learning field for quite sometime now. I know the basics of how, when and where to apply ML, have completed Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree and have also interned at a Startup.

## Future Course of Action

* I will first brush up all my high school maths: stats and probabilty. 
* Will Dive deeper in implementing ML algorithms from scratch (Without use of external library) 
* Will learn/revisit some of the most famous frameworks of ML.
* After all of this will start with real life project


**P.S** : Will improve this file, with more detailed steps, after completing each milestones.
